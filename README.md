# Sacred-Geometry
A program to solve the pathfinder feat Sacred Geometry

The first version of this application was written by my friend Ben, who left it in my caring hands and keyboard, provided I make some things clear:
1) The original state I got it in was the [initial commit](https://github.com/johnhanson/Sacred-Geometry/commit/cb0c1f493980736a56ba0abd9849899ccb6bc5ef) except with maybe one or two irrelevant lines added/changed in the `takeUserInput()` Every commit afterwards is mine unless otherwise stated
2) I put it under a permissive license 

## How to run
It's an eclipse project. Successfully compiled and ran under Java 1.8, earlier/later versions assumed working, but not tested.

## ToDo
1) Make it a GUI application
2) Toggable option to not calculate every possible equation, and instead only solve one equation per level
3) Support Calculating Mind
4) Benchmark Mode
5) General Optimization and speedup
